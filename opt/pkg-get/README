README for pkg-get


REQUERIMENTS

	To use pkg-repgen you'll need prt-get to be installed.


IMPORTANT

	The PKGREPO file format chaged a bit from 0.3.3,
	please regenerate your repositories with pkg-repgen

	the /etc/pkg-get.conf options slightly changed
	in version 0.3.0 in order to handle multiple
	repositories.

	pkg-get is beta software. I did not have much
	time to test it, expecially latest features
	added (locking, pre-post install scripts, printf).
