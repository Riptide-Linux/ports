INSTALLATION

	Once the grub2 port is installed, the boot loader itself can be installed
	like so:

	# grub-install /dev/<device>

	For example, to install grub2 into the master boot record of the first
	SCSI or SATA drive:

	# grub-install /dev/sda

	To install to the second partition of the first SCSI or SATA drive
	instead of the MBR:

	# grub-install /dev/sda2

CONFIGURATION

	A configuration menu file is required for grub2 to do more than display
	a command line. It can be created automatically using the 'grub-mkconfig'
	command like so:

	# grub-mkconfig > /boot/grub/grub.cfg

	It can also be created manually. A sample grub.cfg file is included in the
	port.
