README for bash-completion

POST-INSTALL:

	The easiest way to use bash-completion is to source it from either
	/etc/bashrc or ~/.bashrc (or any other file sourcing those). You can
	do this by simply adding the following line:

	. /etc/bash_completion

	or alternatively:

	# Use bash-completion, if available
	[[ $PS1 && -f /usr/share/bash-completion/bash-completion ]] && \
	. /usr/share/bash-completion/bash-completion

	Note that you can also put additional init code into ~/.bash_completion
